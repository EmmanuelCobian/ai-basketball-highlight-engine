# Basketball Analysis Project

This project analyzes basketball videos to track players, detect ball possession, and identify highlights.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `config.py` - Configuration settings
- `trackers/` - Player, ball, and hoop tracking modules
- `drawers/` - Visualization modules for drawing tracks
- `utils/` - Utility functions for video processing
- `ball_aquisition/` - Ball possession detection logic
- `training_notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for model training

## Ignored Files (Large/Generated Content)

The following files and directories are ignored by Git to keep the repository size manageable:

- **Video files** (`input_videos/`, `output_videos/`) - Large media files
- **Model files** (`*.pt`, `models/`) - Trained model weights (can be large)
- **Training outputs** (`runs/`) - Generated during model training
- **Python cache** (`__pycache__/`) - Automatically generated bytecode

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Add your video files to `input_videos/` (not tracked by Git)
4. Add your trained models to `models/` or root directory (not tracked by Git)

## Usage

Run the main analysis:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Note on Large Files

Video files and trained models are not included in this repository due to their size. You'll need to:

1. Obtain or train your own YOLO models
2. Place them in the appropriate directories
3. Add your input videos to the `input_videos/` folder

Consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage) if you need to version control large files.
