# AI Basketball Highlight Engine - Application Summary

## Overview

The AI Basketball Highlight Engine is an intelligent computer vision application that analyzes basketball game footage to automatically track players, detect ball possession, and identify highlight moments. The system uses advanced SlowFast and YOLO deep learning models combined with sophisticated tracking algorithms to provide real-time analysis and insights.

## Core Value Proposition

### What the Application Does
- **Automatically tracks a specific player** throughout an entire basketball game
- **Detects ball possession** and attributes it to individual players in real-time
- **Analyzes predefined highlight moments** to determine which player dominated each sequence
- **Provides comprehensive statistics** on player performance during key game moments
- **Offers intelligent player re-identification** when tracking is temporarily lost

### Why It's Valuable
- **Automated Analysis**: Eliminates manual video review for player performance analysis
- **Objective Metrics**: Provides data-driven insights into player involvement in key plays
- **Time Efficiency**: Processes hours of footage in real-time with minimal human intervention
- **Coaching Insights**: Helps coaches understand player impact during critical game moments
- **Performance Tracking**: Quantifies player participation in highlight-worthy plays

## User Workflow

### 1. Setup Phase
```
1. User places basketball video file in input_videos/ directory
2. User defines highlight time intervals in highlights.txt file
3. User runs the application: python main.py
4. System loads video and initializes AI models
```

### 2. Player Selection
```
1. Application displays first frame with detected players
2. System shows: "Current player IDs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
3. User inputs: "Enter the player ID to track: 3"
4. System confirms: "Tracking player ID: 3"
```

### 3. Automated Processing
```
1. System processes video frame-by-frame in real-time
2. Tracks the selected player using enhanced AI algorithms
3. Detects ball possession for all players in each frame
4. Identifies when highlight moments occur based on timestamps
5. Displays live tracking status with confidence scores
```

### 4. Intelligent Re-tracking
When the tracked player is temporarily lost:
```
1. System automatically finds best substitute player
2. Continues tracking with "TEMP TRACKING" status
3. Shows countdown: "Original lost: 12/30 frames"
4. After timeout, prompts user: "Confirm this assignment? (y)es/(n)o"
   - YES: Makes substitute the new permanent target
   - NO: Shows ranked suggestions for manual selection
```

### 5. Results Analysis
```
1. System displays highlight-by-highlight breakdown
2. Shows possession statistics for each time interval
3. Determines winner of each highlight moment
4. Provides summary of tracked player's performance
```

## Sample User Interactions

### Initial Player Selection
```
Initial frame - Current player IDs: [1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 15]
Enter the player ID to track for highlights: 5
Tracking player ID: 5
```

### Temporary Assignment Confirmation
```
Confirm temporary assignment: Keep tracking player 7 as permanent replacement for 5?
Confirm this assignment? (y)es/(n)o: y
Player 7 is now permanently tracked (replaced original ID 5)
```

### Manual Player Reselection
```
Player lost for 31 frames. Need user selection.

Suggested reassignments (ID: confidence):
  1. Player 12: 0.85
  2. Player 3: 0.72
  3. Player 8: 0.65
  0. Continue without player-specific tracking

Choose an option (0-3) or enter a specific player ID: 1
Reassigned to player 12
```
